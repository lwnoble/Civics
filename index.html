          <h2>What is our government like and how can you be involved?</h2>
          <p>
            Representative democracy with a judicial court in order. LIfetime memberships do have their vote count as a representative however their numbers cannot exceed those of the actual representatives of the other districts by 30. Districts vote for their side on an issue and a representative casts a vote based on their district. Districts are based on where you live which is for the most part predetermined by your membership. There is no overarching leader and the judicial branch is composed of many small courts to settle disputes. Any major dispute is brought before the representatives and the districts to decide on. Every representative serves a lifetime but gets a tier V citizenship in exchange for being there. They are elected from the people for a person in that district that chooses to run for rep. Each representative of a district has a separate role in addition to casting a vote, and they all manage areas of the economy or jobs to make sure that things are running smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This works best because we are keeping the interests of the people at heart while running public services smoothly on the side. Corruption is hard because each representative is voted by the people for that district, preventing higher districts from being dominant in politics. Tier V citizenship provides a way to incentivize more cash flow into the economy while still being fair as it cannot exceed the number of representatives.
